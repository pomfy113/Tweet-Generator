    <h2>About/FAQ:</h2>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
                To see how far I can possibly go. If I was going to make
                something about a "so bad, it's good" movie, why not go all out?
            </p>
        <h3>No, I mean what was the purpose of this?</h3>
            <p>
                Mostly to showcase what I learned in a basic CS class.
                Sure, the site looks ugly as sin and looks like it took work,
                but most of it actually came from what's going on in the back.
            </p>
        <h3>Like...?</h3>
            <p>For stuff I did:
                <ul>
                <li>
                    It uses a basic 2nd order
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain" style="">Markov Chain</a>
                    So what this basically means is that it grabs two words, then looks
                    ahead and goes "Oh, what word is likely to show up afterwards".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Under the hood is a whole slew of regular expressions. Most if
                    not all of the work being done are actually regex! They do stuff like:
                    <ul><li>Clear out all non-dialogue</li>
                        <li>Handle stop tokens, like periods, exclamations, and question marks</li>
                        <li>Remove misc notes, like [inaudible] or [incomprehensible] sounds.</li>
                        <li>Handle word searching and replacement</li>
                        <li>Clean-up and slicing things into a list of words to use</li>
                        <li>Likely more things I might have forgotten</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Linked lists and stochastic sampling to handle this mess.
                    There's a queue that handles the two words like, say, if you had:<br>
                    "one fish red fish one fish blue fish one fish blue fish"<br>
                    And you get<br>
                    ["one", "fish"]<br>
                    We notice that on the list that after those two words in order,
                    "red" appears one time, and "blue" happens twice.<br>
                    So we roll a three sided dice. "Red" has a 1/3 chance, "Blue" has a 2/3
                </li>
